# New Musings

Tired of going through online resources to search for new music released everyday
(which is exactly what I have been doing throughout this pandemic), I decided to automate
the process with this script, which adds the highest rated new music from AOTY
to my new music playlist daily.

This is pretty simple so far, and still a work in progress. I hope to do more with it
and not just rely on AOTY and its new releases page for my daily fix.
